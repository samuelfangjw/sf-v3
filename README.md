# Samuel's Personal Website

sf-v3 is the third iteration of my personal website, created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Charkra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).

## Installation & Local Setup

First, install the necessary dependencies. Ensure you have an up to date version of Node.js.

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
